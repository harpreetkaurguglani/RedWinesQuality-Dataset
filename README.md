# RedWinesQuality-Dataset

Regression Analysis attempting to predict the quality of wine according to the several predictors included in the data set. 

The Red Wine Dataset had 1599 rows and 12 columns. Here our response variable is 'quality' which is numeric variable as we need to perform regression analysis, and the rest of the predictors and variables are numerical variables which reflect the physical and chemical properties of the wine.There are no NAs in the dataset.The data is splited in 7:3 ratio for training and testing purpose split.The summary looks good.

The Quality is rated from 1-10 ratings and the ratings with 6.5 and above is considered as a good quality. Data is not having equal quality amongst the different category/the quality. But since we are performing the regression analysis we would move froward with the exact dataset without categorizing it. The main point of interest here is in the 'quality' variable influced by the other variables. I would like to determine which factors determine the quality of a wine.
